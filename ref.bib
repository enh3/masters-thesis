	abstract = {The study of timbre by music researchers is seriously underdeveloped in both the humanities and human sciences. As applied to instrumental music, theories to explain instrumental combinations and timbral shaping through instrumentation and orchestration are rare. Analyses of orchestration treatises and musical scores reveal an implicit understanding of auditory grouping principles by which many orchestral techniques and their perceptual effects function. This chapter, with a primary focus on classical Western orchestral and electroacoustic music, discusses connections between orchestration practice and perceptual principles based on research in auditory scene analysis and timbre perception. The chapter explores: (1) listeners’ abilities to perceive relations among timbres; (2) how concurrent grouping cues result in blended or heterogeneous combinations of instruments; (3) how sequential groupings into segregated melodic streams and stratified foreground and background layers are influenced by timbral similarities and differences; and (4) how segmental grouping cues based on changes in instrument timbre and instrumental textures create musical units, formal boundaries, and expressive shaping of timbre melodies and larger-scale orchestral gestures.},

	abstract = {Timbral semantics is the study of adjectives relating to timbre. This thesis takes existing
research on timbral adjectives relating to single source sounds and applies it to the pipe
organ, a complex multi-source musical instrument.
A substantial literature review suggested an analysis/synthesis methodology, and a
preliminary experiment suggested that common understanding could be demonstrated
for some adjectives. Further listening experiments gathered appropriate adjectives from
English-speaking listeners and suggested that those adjectives could vary with age,
geographic location and visual stimulus presented.
Seven timbral adjectives were selected for further study and used as rating scales in a
series of listening experiments using both recorded and synthesised ensembles. Five of
those words demonstrated common understanding, and several demonstrated
consistent correlation with spectral features derived from acoustic analyses. The
spectral and perceptual effect of a reverberant environment was also examined.
The hypothesis was proven, and the work was novel in both its scope and contribution
to knowledge. Complex ensembles were explored both acoustically and perceptually,
and the results have strong applicability outside of the context of the pipe organ.},

	abstract = {Sound recordings of twelve pipe organs from four European countries (six Baroque, two Romantic and four contemporary) were subjectively evaluated. Principal sound contexts of Principal 8' (pitches C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6) were judged by twelve organ experts on dissimilarity in timbre. Perceptual space was constructed for each of the five tested sound contexts, using the multi-dimensional scaling latent class approach. Levels of individual harmonics and levels in third of octaves were used for the interpretation of perceptual spaces. The method of embedding of these acoustic characteristics into perceptual space contributed to the discovering of the main spectral features, significantly influencing perception, and established their relations (similarity, opposition, or independence) in each context. Level of the fundamental, levels of high frequency components and levels of noise components in the band about 100 - 200 Hz proved to be the main spectral features, influencing the perception of the timbre of the organ pipe sound. Pitch dependence of their mutual relations and frequency positions are also found and discussed.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this study is to understand how timbre semantic associations—for example, a sound’s timbre perceived as bright, rough, or hollow—vary with register and pitch height across instruments. In this experiment, 540 online participants rated single, sustained notes from eight Western orchestral instruments (flute, oboe, bass clarinet, trumpet, trombone, violin, cello, and vibraphone) across three registers (low, medium, and high) on 20 semantic scales derived from Reymore and Huron (2020). The 24 two-second stimuli, equalized in loudness, were produced using the Vienna Symphonic Library.Exploratory modeling examined relationships between mean ratings of each semantic dimension and instrument, register, and participant musician identity (“musician” vs. “nonmusician”). For most semantic descriptors, both register and instrument were significant predictors, though the amount of variance explained differed (marginal R2). Terms that had the strongest positive relationships with register include shrill/harsh/noisy, sparkling/brilliant/bright, ringing/long decay, and percussive. Terms with the strongest negative relationships with register include deep/thick/heavy, raspy/grainy/gravelly, hollow, and woody. Post hoc modeling using only pitch height and only register to predict mean semantic rating suggests that pitch height may explain more variance than does register. Results help clarify the influence of both instrument and relative register (and pitch height) on common timbre semantic associations.},

We suggest a classification of 55 of these terms, based on the perception of professional music performers who were asked to: 1) organize the considered {EMTs} in a two-dimensional plane in such a way that proximity reflects similarity; and 2) rate these {EMTs} according to valence, arousal, extraversion, and neuroticism, using 7-level Likert scales. Using a minimization procedure, we found that a satisfactory partition requires these {EMTs} to be organized in four clusters (whose centroids are associated with tenderness, happiness, anger, and sadness) located in the four quarters of the valence-arousal plane of the circumplex model of affect developed by Russell (1980). In terms of the related positive-negative activation parameters, introduced by Watson and Tellegen (1985), we obtained a significant correlation between positive activation and extraversion and between negative activation and neuroticism. This demonstrates that these relations, previously observed in personality studies by Watson \& Clark (1992a), extend to the musical field.},

Then a discussion follows of how a computer simulation of a four-level {ART} network—a simulation dubbed L'{ART} pour l'art—independently categorized musical events in Mozart's six earliest compositions. The ability of the network to abstract significant voiceleading combinations from these pieces (and in fact to detect a possible error in the New Mozart Edition) suggests that this approach holds promise for the study of how ordinary listeners process music's multidimensional complexity. In addition, the categorizations produced by the network are suggestive of alternative conceptualizations of music's hierarchical structure.},

Initially used for the structural annotation of pop songs (Bimbot, Deruty, Sargent, \& Vincent, 2012), the S\&C model provides a framework to describe implication patterns in musical segments by encoding similarities and relations between its elements. It is applicable at several timescales to various musical dimensions in a polymorphous way, thus offering an attractive meta-description of musical contents. We formalize the S\&C model, illustrate how it applies to music and establish its filiation with Narmour’s implication-realization model (Narmour, 1990, 1992) and cognitive rule-mapping (Narmour, 2000). We introduce the minimum description length scheme as a productive paradigm to support the estimation of S\&C descriptions. The S\&C model highlights promising connections between music data processing and information retrieval on the one hand, and modern theories in music perception, cognition and semiotics on the other hand, together with interesting perspectives in Musicology.},

Frances Dyson takes an historical approach, focusing on technologies that became available in the mid-twentieth century-electronics, imaging, and digital and computer processing-and analyzing the work of such artists as John Cage, Edgard Varèse, Antonin Artaud, and Char Davies. She utilizes sound's intangibility to study ideas about embodiment (or its lack) in art and technology as well as fears about technology and the so-called "post-human." Dyson argues that the concept of "immersion" has become a path leading away from aesthetic questions about meaning and toward questions about embodiment and the physical. The result is an insightful journey through the new technologies derived from electronics, imaging, and digital and computer processing, toward the creation of an aesthetic and philosophical framework for considering the least material element of an artwork, sound.},

This study takes advantage of the pipe organ to concentrate on that aspect of musical dynamics determined by the physical parameters of steady sounds, leaving aside the admittedly important effects of other variables such as context and articulation. Juries of musicians and music students provided judgments of musical dynamic levels produced by steady sounding of various stops and combinations on two pipe organs. The physical strength of each of these sounds was measured, and they were analyzed in \${\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{3\}\$ octave band spectra. Correlations between the physical parameters and the musical judgments were examined. Results of this study provide some support for the hypothesis that loudness calculated by a procedure such as Zwicker's will be a good predictor of the steady aspect of musical dynamic strength, whereas a simple unweighted sound level in decibels is rather poor.},

	abstract = {The design of a digital musical instrument is often informed by the needs of the first performance or composition. Following the initial performances, the designer frequently confronts the question of how to build a larger community of performers and composers around the instrument. Later musicians are likely to approach the instrument on different terms than those involved in the design process, so design decisions that promote a successful first performance will not necessarily translate to broader uptake. This article addresses the process of bringing an existing instrument to a wider musical community, including how musician feedback can be used to refine the instrument's design without compromising its identity. As a case study, the article presents the magnetic resonator piano, an electronically augmented acoustic grand piano that uses electromagnets to induce vibrations in the strings. After initial compositions and performances using the instrument, feedback from composers and performers guided refinements to the design, laying the groundwork for a collaborative project in which six composers wrote pieces for the instrument. The pieces exhibited a striking diversity of style and technique, including instrumental techniques never considered by the designer. The project, which culminated in two concert performances, demonstrates how a new instrument can acquire a community of musicians beyond those initially involved.},

Frances Dyson takes an historical approach, focusing on technologies that became available in the mid-twentieth century-electronics, imaging, and digital and computer processing-and analyzing the work of such artists as John Cage, Edgard Varèse, Antonin Artaud, and Char Davies. She utilizes sound's intangibility to study ideas about embodiment (or its lack) in art and technology as well as fears about technology and the so-called "post-human." Dyson argues that the concept of "immersion" has become a path leading away from aesthetic questions about meaning and toward questions about embodiment and the physical. The result is an insightful journey through the new technologies derived from electronics, imaging, and digital and computer processing, toward the creation of an aesthetic and philosophical framework for considering the least material element of an artwork, sound.},

Similar previous work has concentrated on single pipes in anechoic conditions (e.g. Rioux, 2001). This work examines pipe organ ensembles as a cohesive whole. Ninety -nine English-speaking subjects were asked to describe recordings of pipe organs. From the many timbral adjectives they used, seven words were chosen that were useful, unambiguous and frequently used. In two experiments, guided by previous studies of timbral adjectives in other timbre spaces, the spectral correlates and common understanding of these words was examined. All five words that exhibited common understanding had spectral correlates that to some degree supported theories suggested by previous research. The earlier part of this work was presented in Disley \& Hpward (2003). This research has since been developed and refined, with particular emphasis on careful selection of adjectives for study and detailed consideration of steady-state spectral correlates. Most clearly defined existing theories of spectral correlation appear to hold true in this complex timbre space. This paper was presented at the Joint Baltic -Nordic Acoustics Meeting ({BNAM}},

Accordingly, I ask whether Machaut organizes his tenors in a way that allows for other such strong progressions to occur at prominent locations throughout a motet. By drawing upon the available fourteenth-century sources that deal with the initial steps of motet composition, I first provide a detailed account of the various ways in which Machaut organizes all of his chant-based tenors. To elucidate how my method differs from that of other scholars, I next illustrate the structures of three tenors that involve equal segmentation. In the paper's second half, I focus on the segmentation of Motet 3' s tenor, investigate the foundational melody's potential for tonal articulation, and speculate about its anomalous structure.},

            Do our subjective experiences when listening to music show evidence of universality? And if so, what is the nature of these experiences? With data-driven methodological and statistical approaches, we examined the feelings evoked by 2,168 music excerpts in the United States and China. We uncovered 13 distinct types of experiences that people across 2 different cultures report in listening to music of different kinds. Categories such as “awe” drive the experience of music more so than broad affective features like valence. However, emotions that scientists have long treated as discrete can be blended together. Our results provide answers to long-standing questions about the nature of the subjective experiences associated with music.

              What is the nature of the feelings evoked by music? We investigated how people represent the subjective experiences associated with Western and Chinese music and the form in which these representational processes are preserved across different cultural groups. {US} ( 
              n 
              = 1,591) and Chinese ( 
              n 
              = 1,258) participants listened to 2,168 music samples and reported on the specific feelings (e.g., “angry,” “dreamy”) or broad affective features (e.g., valence, arousal) that they made individuals feel. Using large-scale statistical tools, we uncovered 13 distinct types of subjective experience associated with music in both cultures. Specific feelings such as “triumphant” were better preserved across the 2 cultures than levels of valence and arousal, contrasting with theoretical claims that valence and arousal are building blocks of subjective experience. This held true even for music selected on the basis of its valence and arousal levels and for traditional Chinese music. Furthermore, the feelings associated with music were found to occupy continuous gradients, contradicting discrete emotion theories. Our findings, visualized within an interactive map ( 
              https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/∼acowen/music.html 
              ) reveal a complex, high-dimensional space of subjective experience associated with music in multiple cultures. These findings can inform inquiries ranging from the etiology of affective disorders to the neurological basis of emotion.},

An independent group was asked to assess a number of acoustical properties for those same instruments. Using the estimated acoustical properties as predictor variables in a multiple regression analysis, a significant correlation was found between those properties known to contribute to sad prosody in speech and the judged sadness of the instruments. The best predictor variable was the ability of the instrument to make small pitch movements. Other variables investigated included the darkness of the timbre, the ability to play low pitches, the ability to play quietly, and the capacity of the instrument to “mumble.” Four of the acoustical factors were found to exhibit a considerable amount of shared variance, suggesting that they may originate in a common underlying factor. It is suggested that the shared proximal cause of these acoustical features may be low physical energy.},

We also provide a critique of this research, noting that previous studies have tended to neglect the social context of music listening. The most likely reason for this neglect, we argue, is that that most research on musical emotion has, implicitly or explicitly, taken the perspective of the musician in understanding responses to music. In contrast, we argue that a promising avenue toward a better understanding of emotional responses to music involves diary and questionnaire studies of how ordinary listeners actually use music in everyday life contexts. Accordingly, we present findings from an exploratory questionnaire study featuring 141 music listeners (between 17 and 74 years of age) that offers some novel insights. The results provide preliminary estimates of the occurrence of various emotions in listening to music, as well as clues to how music is used by listeners in a number of different emotional ways in various life contexts. These results confirm that emotion is strongly related to most people's primary motives for listening to music.},

	abstract = {Factor-analytic evidence has led most psychologists to describe affect as a set of dimensions, such as displeasure, distress, depression, excitement, and so on, with each dimension varying independently of the others. However, there is other evidence that rather than being independent, these affective dimensions are interrelated in a highly systematic fashion. The evidence suggests that these interrelationships can be represented by a spatial model in which affective concepts fall in a circle in the following order: pleasure (0), excitement (45), arousal (90), distress (135), displeasure (180), depression (225), sleepiness (270), and relaxation (315). This model was offered both as a way psychologists can represent the structure of affective experience, as assessed through self-report, and as a representation of the cognitive structure that laymen utilize in conceptualizing affect. Supportive evidence was obtained by scaling 28 emotion-denoting adjectives in 4 different ways: R. T. Ross's (1938) technique for a circular ordering of variables, a multidimensional scaling procedure based on perceived similarity among the terms, a unidimensional scaling on hypothesized pleasure–displeasure and degree-of-arousal dimensions, and a principal-components analysis of 343 Ss' self-reports of their current affective states.
